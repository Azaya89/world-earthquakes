# World Earthquake Data


This is a project that shows the magnitude of earthquakes around the world for the past one month.

It was plotted using Plotly and each point in the map has information about each earthquake, including the geo-location and place name. The size and colour intensity of the dots represent the magnitude of the earthquales.


The raw data was gotten from [here](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson).
